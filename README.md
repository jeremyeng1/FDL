# FDL
A now depreciated website development for startup FDLNFT. 


This website allowed for prospective customers to view nfts on marketplace, users could also create an account to join a waiting list for when the nfts were minted 

Utilized react.js for front-end ui

No longer running, as the company has been dissolved: though a prototype can be found at this link:
